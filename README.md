# RWBYEventHorizon
A Reddit bot to compile every image crossing /r/RWBY into a single imgur album.


Does exactly what it says. Or rather, it will. Still have to get direct imgur links from the reddit itself,
then have to figure out how to make it into an imgur album. Probably will have to address duplication
somewhere along the way, but that's a problem for another day's me.
